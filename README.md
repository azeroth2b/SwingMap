# SwingMap
SwingMap is a private effort to maintain a map of all the swing scenes in the world.  Scenes are user-submitted, validated by humans, and then stored for all time.  We import a few other lists maintained by other dancers for completeness.

At present, we do not maintain blues scenes, but have that as a long term goal.
